#MetaScraper

MetaScraper scrapes Morph.io itself to determine the database schemas used by other scrapers.

This data is used to test and validate the Mermade Morph-Proxy database query builder.

This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)
